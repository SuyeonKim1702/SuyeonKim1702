💻 Driven iOS Software Engineer 

 As an iOS developer with over 3.5 years of experience, working on LINE WORKS. I specialize in building and optimizing scalable, secure enterprise communication and collaboration solutions.
Developing a large-scale app has strengthened my ability to address diverse requirements from international users while ensuring stability and reliability.


💪🏻 Key Strengths

👩🏻‍🔧 Developing with Stability and Flexibility
Our app is large-scale, with complex business logic and varying features for different users. Additionally, as a B2B service, it requires high security and stability. In such an environment, I have focused on designing solutions that can adapt to diverse requirements, while ensuring robustness and reliability in the development process.


👥 Collaborating Across Various Roles
I have extensive experience collaborating with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers, server developers, and QA engineers. Through these interactions, I have honed my ability to communicate effectively and work towards a shared goal.


 💫 Problem-Solving with a Flexible Mindset
I strive to think beyond a single solution, exploring multiple alternatives to tackle problems. I approach challenges with a sense of responsibility and ownership, always committed to delivering effective solutions.


📚 Constant Learning and Passion for Innovation
I have a strong passion for learning new technologies and sharing knowledge with others. I enjoy applying the techniques I’ve learned in real-world projects and always seek opportunities to refine my skills.
